Binary firmware images generated by compiling the examples hosted in this repository, plus the rpl-border-router.
Two sets of images are provided, one for the 868 MHz and one for the 915 MHz version of the SPIRIT1 expansion board.
Simply copy the .bin on the USB mass storage that is automatically created when plugging the STM32 Nucleo board to the PC.

* XXX-MHz/rpl-border-router/border-router-XXX.bin: to be used with 'tunslip6' application to access the 6LoWPAN network from a IPv6 host/network (no need of sensors expansion board).
* XXX-MHz/sensor-demo/sensor-demo-XXX.bin: prints the sensor values on the terminal (sensors expansion board required).
* XXX-MHz/sensor-er-rest-example/sensor-er-example-server-XXX.bin: implements a CoAP server that exposes the sensors of the STM32 Nucleo expansion board (sensors expansion board required).
* XXX-MHz/sensor-udp-rpl/unicast-sensor-sender-XXX.bin: implements the sending of UDP messages carrying  sensor data, acting as UDP client (sensors expansion board required).
* XXX-MHz/sensor-udp-rpl/unicast-sensor-receiver-XXX.bin:  implements the receiving of UDP messages, acting as UDP server (no need of sensors expansion board).
